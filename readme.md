# Auto Open Notes - a Sublime Text 3 Plugin

When a new window is opened with a single folder
1. A `.sublime.autoopen` file is looked for.  If it exists, each file listed in the file is then opened
2. Otherwise it'll look for a `notes.txt`, then `readme.md`, then `readme` files and opens the first


## To Install

    cd "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/auto_open_notes/notes.txt"
    git clone https://github.com/noahcoad/auto_open_notes.git
